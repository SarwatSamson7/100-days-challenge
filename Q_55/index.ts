//Question 55: Double Numbers in an Array: Make a list of numbers. Then, use a trick to make a new list where each number is twice its original value.

//Explain & TIP: We can use a special tool to go through each number in our list and make a new list with each number doubled.

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
let doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2) ;

console.log(doubledNumbers)
