//Question 52: Make a Smartphone Object: Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand, model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of its screen, and how long its battery lasts.

//Explain & TIP: Just like a box can contain smaller boxes, objects can contain other objects. This helps organize related information neatly.


let smartphone = {
    brand: "Poco",
    model: "X3NFC",
    specs: {
      storage: "128GB",
      screensize: "6 inches",
      batterylife: "20 Hours",
    },
  };
  
  console.log(smartphone);
