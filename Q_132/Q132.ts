// Discuss the difference between default and named exports in typescript modules.


// Typescript provides two main types of exports:default and named.A module can have only one default export but multiple named exports.This flexibility supports various use cases in module designs.



// Importing named exports:

import { utilOne,utilTwo } from "./utils";



// Importing a default export:


import Calculator from "./calculator";

// This code illustrates the syntax and usage difference between default and named exports.
